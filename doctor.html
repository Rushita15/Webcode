Doctor Dolittle isn't a normal doctor . . .<br><br>

He doesn't treat humans - he treats animals instead! He loves animals so much that his busy house in Puddleby-on-the-Marsh is full of every creature imaginable - from parrots to pigs, monkeys to dogs and many more - and very soon he even learns how to speak their language.
<br><br>

The doctor's animal friends are quick to tell him that the monkeys in Africa have become infected with a terrible disease, so with a team of trusty creatures by his side the kind-hearted doctor sets off on an action-packed adventure to save them.<br><br>

Hugh Lofting's The Story of Doctor Dolittle is one of the most fun, delightful and imaginative stories in children's literature. Featuring the eccentric doctor who learns to talk to animals, the novel has been adapted as a major film starring Robert Downey Jr., Emma Thompson and Selena Gomez. This beautiful paperback edition is illustrated with original line drawing from Hugh Lofting himself and contains engaging bonus material such as a quiz and a word search.<br><br>
